Super Mario Brothers 3 recreated in the Godot game engine
Currently using Godot v3.2.3

An open source attempt to recreate Super Mario Brothers 3 as faithfully as possible, with the exception of being ported to a 16:9 widescreen resolution, which has resulted in the screen being 4 pixels shorter vertically, but 168 pixels wider.
